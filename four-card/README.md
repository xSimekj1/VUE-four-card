# four-card

## Problems during development:

- **dynamic image rendering**  
  image: require('./assets/icon-supervisor.svg')  
- **global scss styles**  
  could not include variables from main.scss into other components, further research needed  
- **forgot how to include font families**  
  @font-face {  
    font-family: "Poppins";  
    src: url("../assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf");  
    font-weight: 600;  
    font-style: normal;  
  }
